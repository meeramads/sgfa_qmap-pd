## Critical Bug Fixes (2)

These two fixes address actual bugs that were affecting the correctness of results.

---

### 1. Consensus Loading Calculation Bug Fix

**Commit**: `d92a5f7c` (Oct 27, 10:48 AM)
**File**: `analysis/factor_stability.py`
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Directly affected consensus results

#### The Bug

The code had a conditional branch that used the **wrong data** when computing consensus loadings:

```python
# BUGGY CODE (Before fix):
if isinstance(result["W"], list):
    # WRONG: Used pre-split W list instead of averaging MCMC samples!
    W_concat = np.vstack([W_view for W_view in result["W"]])
    W_chain_avg.append(W_concat)
else:
    # CORRECT: Average across samples
    W_avg = np.mean(W_samples, axis=0)
    W_chain_avg.append(W_avg)
```

**Problem**:
- The `if isinstance(result["W"], list)` branch used `result["W"]` directly
- `result["W"]` is a list of view-specific loading matrices, **not** posterior samples
- This was likely a **point estimate** or **single sample**, not the average of 2,000 MCMC samples
- **Result**: Consensus calculated from wrong data → incorrect consensus loadings

#### The Fix

```python
# FIXED CODE (After fix):
# IMPORTANT: W_samples from MCMC is already concatenated across views
# Shape: (n_samples, sum(D_m), K) where sum(D_m) is total features across all views
# We need to average across the samples dimension (axis=0)
W_avg = np.mean(W_samples, axis=0)  # (sum(D_m), K)
W_chain_avg.append(W_avg)
logger.info(f"Chain {chain_id}: Averaged W samples -> shape {W_avg.shape}")
```

**What changed**:
- Removed the incorrect conditional branch
- Always use `W_samples` from MCMC results
- Properly average across the samples dimension (axis=0)
- W_samples is already concatenated across views: shape `(n_samples, 1808, K)` for your data

#### Impact on Your Oct 27 Run

**This bug was ACTIVE during your Oct 27 00:12 run** (started before the 10:48 AM fix)

**Observed symptoms that match this bug**:
1. ✅ **Voxel collapse**: 94-97% of voxels had identical loading values
   - Using wrong data source could cause repeated values
2. ✅ **Poor interpretability**: Clinical parameters showing enforced positivity
   - Averaging wrong data could produce nonsensical patterns
3. ✅ **Flipped relationships**: Positive-positive instead of positive-negative contralateral
   - Using point estimate instead of posterior mean could miss sign variability

**Why this matters**:
- Consensus loadings are the **primary output** used for interpretation
- Using wrong data for consensus = entire analysis invalid for that run
- Oct 22 run likely didn't hit this bug path (different code version)

### 2. Sign Alignment Using Normalized Cosine Similarity

**Commit**: `85e01ffe` (Oct 27, 3:22 PM)
**File**: `analysis/factor_stability.py`
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Prevents attenuation artifacts in consensus

#### The Bug

Sign alignment used **raw dot product** instead of **normalized cosine similarity**:

```python
# BUGGY CODE (Before fix):
for loading in matched_loadings[1:]:
    # Raw dot product - magnitude dependent!
    correlation = np.dot(reference, loading)
    if correlation < 0:
        aligned_loadings.append(-loading)
    else:
        aligned_loadings.append(loading)
```

**Problem**:
- Raw dot product depends on both **angle** AND **magnitude**
- If chain A has ||W|| = 10 and chain B has ||W|| = 1, dot product is biased
- Could flip signs incorrectly if magnitudes differ significantly
- **Result**: Incorrect sign alignment → consensus median attenuates toward zero

#### The Fix

```python
# FIXED CODE (After fix):
for chain_idx, loading in enumerate(matched_loadings[1:], start=1):
    # Compute NORMALIZED correlation (cosine similarity)
    loading_norm = np.linalg.norm(loading)
    ref_norm = np.linalg.norm(reference)

    # Handle near-zero vectors (heavily shrunk factors)
    if ref_norm < 1e-10 and loading_norm < 1e-10:
        # Both shrunk to zero - just use as-is
        aligned_loadings.append(loading)
    elif ref_norm < 1e-10 or loading_norm < 1e-10:
        # One shrunk, one not - magnitude mismatch warning
        logger.warning(f"Factor {factor_idx}: Magnitude mismatch between chains")
        aligned_loadings.append(loading)
    else:
        # Normal case: compute normalized cosine similarity
        # cosine_sim = dot(a,b) / (||a|| * ||b||)
        # Ranges from -1 (opposite) to +1 (same direction)
        cosine_sim = np.dot(reference, loading) / (ref_norm * loading_norm)

        if cosine_sim < 0:
            # Negative correlation - flip sign to align
            aligned_loadings.append(-loading)
            logger.debug(f"Factor {factor_idx}: Chain {chain_idx} FLIPPED (cosine={cosine_sim:.3f})")
        else:
            aligned_loadings.append(loading)
            logger.debug(f"Factor {factor_idx}: Chain {chain_idx} aligned (cosine={cosine_sim:.3f})")
```

**What changed**:
1. **Compute norms** for both reference and comparison loadings
2. **Normalize dot product**: `cosine_sim = dot(a,b) / (||a|| × ||b||)`
3. **Handle edge cases**: Zero vectors, magnitude mismatches
4. **Enhanced logging**: Report cosine similarity values for diagnostics

**Same fix applied to factor scores** (`Z` matrices)

#### Mathematical Explanation

**Cosine similarity** measures the **angle** between vectors, independent of magnitude:

```
cosine(a, b) = (a · b) / (||a|| × ||b||)

Properties:
- Range: [-1, 1]
- +1: Same direction (aligned)
- 0: Orthogonal (independent)
- -1: Opposite direction (need to flip)

Comparison to raw dot product:
- dot(a, b) = ||a|| × ||b|| × cos(θ)
- Depends on BOTH angle θ AND magnitudes ||a||, ||b||
- Magnitude differences can mask sign flipping needs
```

**Example where raw dot product fails**:
```
Chain A: W = [10, 10, 10]   (||W|| = 17.3)
Chain B: W = [-1, -1, -1]   (||W|| = 1.73)

Raw dot product:   dot(A, B) = -30 → correctly flips
BUT if Chain B:    W = [-0.5, -0.5, -0.5]   (||W|| = 0.87)
Raw dot product:   dot(A, B) = -15 → still flips

Cosine similarity:
  cosine(A, B) = -30 / (17.3 × 1.73) = -1.0 → correctly identifies opposite
  cosine(A, B2) = -15 / (17.3 × 0.87) = -1.0 → same result!

Scale-invariant: Only cares about direction, not magnitude
```

#### Impact on Your Oct 27 Run

**This bug was ACTIVE during your Oct 27 00:12 run** (fixed at 3:22 PM, after run started)

**How this could cause observed symptoms**:

1. **Voxel attenuation**:
   - Incorrect sign flips → some chains have opposite signs
   - Median([+5, -5, +5]) = +5, but mean([+5, -5, +5]) ≈ +1.67
   - If sign alignment wrong, median still attenuates
   - Could contribute to voxel collapse (many voxels → same median value)

2. **Sign pattern artifacts**:
   - If some chains incorrectly aligned, consensus has mixed signs
   - Could create spurious positive/negative patterns
   - Might explain "enforced positivity" if flipping was systematic

3. **Magnitude-dependent errors**:
   - Clinical loadings (smaller magnitude) vs. imaging (larger magnitude)
   - Raw dot product more likely to err on smaller-magnitude features
   - Could asymmetrically affect clinical parameters

**Combined with consensus bug**:
- Using wrong data source (bug #1) + incorrect sign alignment (bug #2)
- **Double-whammy**: Both bugs active in same run
- Likely explains severe artifacts in Oct 27 results

## Visualization Fixes (3)

These fixes address plotting issues and redundancies, improving output quality.

### 3. TauW Plotting Redundancy Removal

**Commit**: `aeeb0fec` (Oct 27, 12:04 PM)
**File**: `analysis/mcmc_diagnostics.py`
**Issue**: Plotting same tauW trace K times per view

#### The Problem

**Background**: `tauW` is the **global shrinkage parameter** in the regularized horseshoe prior:
```
tauW^(m) ~ Student-t⁺(df=2, scale=τ₀^(m))
```
- **Shape**: Scalar per view (M scalars total)
- **NOT per-factor**: Same tauW used for all K factors within a view

**Buggy behavior**:
- Code plotted tauW for "each factor" (K plots per view)
- But tauW is the **same value** for all factors in a view
- **Result**: K identical plots per view (redundant)
- For your data: 5 identical plots for imaging, 5 identical for clinical = 10 redundant plots

#### The Fix

**Posterior plots** (histogram of posterior distribution):
```python
# BEFORE: Loop over factors
for k in range(K):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))
    # ... plot tauW[view_idx, k] (but k is ignored - same for all k!)
    _save_individual_plot(fig, f"posterior_tauW_view{view_idx+1}_factor{k}", output_dir)

# AFTER: Single plot per view
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))
# ... plot tauW[view_idx] (scalar per view)
ax.set_title(f'tauW Posterior ({view_label})\n[per-view global scale]')
_save_individual_plot(fig, f"posterior_tauW_{view_label}", output_dir)
```

**Trace plots** (time series of samples):
```python
# BEFORE: K columns per view, all showing same trace
for k in range(K):
    ax = axes[view_idx, k]
    # ... plot same tauW trace K times

# AFTER: First column shows tauW, others marked "N/A"
for k in range(K):
    ax = axes[view_idx, k]
    if k == 0:
        # Plot tauW only in first column
        ax.set_title(f'tauW Trace ({view_label})\n[per-view global scale]')
        # ... plot tauW trace
    else:
        # Mark other columns as N/A
        ax.text(0.5, 0.5, 'N/A\n(tauW is per-view)',
                ha='center', va='center', fontsize=10)
        ax.set_title(f'Factor {k} (N/A)')
```

#### Impact

**Before**: 10 redundant files (5 per view × 2 views)
**After**: 2 files (1 per view)

**Benefits**:
- Clearer output structure
- Less disk space
- Easier to navigate results
- Correct labeling clarifies model structure

---

### 4. Visualization Subdirectory Organization

**Commit**: `540ee623` (Oct 27, 8:47 AM)
**Files**: `analysis/mcmc_diagnostics.py`, `experiments/data_validation.py`, `experiments/framework.py`, `run_experiments.py`
**Issue**: Improved directory structure for plots

#### Changes

1. **Added subdirectory organization**:
   ```
   results/run_name/
   ├── individual_plots/
   │   ├── hyperparameters/    # tauW, sigma traces
   │   ├── loadings/           # W posteriors
   │   └── scores/             # Z posteriors
   └── summary_plots/
       └── convergence_summary.png
   ```

2. **Clearer naming conventions**:
   - `trace_tauW_SN.png` → hyperparameters subdirectory
   - `posterior_W_SN_Factor0.png` → loadings subdirectory
   - `posterior_Z_Factor0.png` → scores subdirectory

3. **Consistent path handling** across experiments

#### Impact

**Benefits**:
- Easier to find specific plot types
- Reduced clutter in main results directory
- Better organization for publications

### 5. Save Only PNG Files (Remove PDF)

**Commit**: `be253d5c` (Oct 27, 12:13 PM)
**Files**: `analysis/mcmc_diagnostics.py`, `experiments/framework.py`, `experiments/train_sparse_gfa_fixed.py`, `run_experiments.py`, `verify_position_lookup_structure.py`
**Issue**: Duplicate PDF files consuming disk space

#### The Change

**Before**:
```python
fig.savefig(f"{filename}.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
fig.savefig(f"{filename}.pdf", bbox_inches='tight')  # Duplicate in vector format
```

**After**:
```python
fig.savefig(f"{filename}.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
# PDF saving removed
```

**Removed from**:
- `analysis/mcmc_diagnostics.py`: Line 43-48
- `experiments/framework.py`: Lines 1286-1287
- `experiments/train_sparse_gfa_fixed.py`: Lines 457-458
- `run_experiments.py`: Lines 1011-1012
- `verify_position_lookup_structure.py`: Lines 29-32

#### Impact

**Before**: 2 files per plot (PNG + PDF)
**After**: 1 file per plot (PNG only)

**Disk space saved**: ~50% for plot files
- PDFs are larger than PNGs for complex plots
- Typical run: 50-100 plots → 50-100 fewer files

**Rationale**:
- PNG sufficient for most analysis and documentation
- PDF useful for publications, but can regenerate if needed
- GPU workstation has limited disk space

### 6. Covariance Plot Error Fixes

**Commit**: `f8c119f0` (Oct 27, 8:23 AM)
**File**: `visualization/covariance_plots.py`
**Issue**: Error handling for empty/invalid data

#### The Change

Added error handling for edge cases in covariance computation:

```python
# Added checks for:
# 1. Empty data matrices
# 2. Single-sample data (cannot compute covariance)
# 3. NaN/Inf values in covariance matrix
# 4. Singular matrices (all features constant)

# Example fix:
if X.shape[0] < 2:
    logger.warning(f"View {view_name}: Insufficient samples ({X.shape[0]}) for covariance")
    return None

# Added validation:
if np.any(np.isnan(cov)) or np.any(np.isinf(cov)):
    logger.warning(f"View {view_name}: Invalid covariance matrix (NaN/Inf detected)")
    return None
```

#### Impact

**Before**: Crashes on edge cases
**After**: Graceful warnings and skipping

**Benefits**:
- More robust pipeline
- Clearer error messages
- Pipeline doesn't fail completely on invalid data

## Critical Insight: Oct 27 Run Had TWO Active Bugs

Your Oct 27 00:12 AM run was affected by **both critical bugs**:

1. ✅ **Consensus calculation bug** (fixed 10:48 AM - 10.6 hours after run started)
   - Used wrong data source for consensus
   - Could cause voxel collapse (94-97% identical values observed)

2. ✅ **Sign alignment bug** (fixed 3:22 PM - 15.2 hours after run started)
   - Used magnitude-dependent dot product instead of normalized cosine
   - Could cause incorrect sign flips and attenuation

**Combined effect**:
- Wrong data source + incorrect sign alignment = severely corrupted consensus
- Explains all observed symptoms:
  - Voxel collapse (identical loadings)
  - Enforced positivity (systematic sign errors)
  - Flipped contralateral relationships (incorrect alignment)

**Oct 22 run**:
- Neither bug present in that version of code
- Different model hyperparameters (see CODEBASE_CHANGES_OCT22_TO_OCT27.md)
- Results were interpretable because:
  1. Consensus calculation correct
  2. Sign alignment correct (or simpler alignment method)

---

## Recommendations

### For Current Analysis (Using Oct 22 Results)

**Strengths**:
- No bugs in consensus calculation
- No bugs in sign alignment
- Simpler hyperparameters (slab_scale=2.0, uniform τ₀ floors)
- **Interpretable, scientifically sensible results**

**Methods section should note**:
- Analysis used version from Oct 22, 2025
- Subsequent bug fixes identified and corrected in later versions
- Results are valid for this version

### For Future Runs

**Required changes** (bug fixes):
- ✅ Use consensus fix (commit d92a5f7c)
- ✅ Use normalized cosine alignment (commit 85e01ffe)

**Recommended changes** (improvements):
- ✅ Keep subdirectory organization (commit 540ee623)
- ✅ Keep tauW plot fix (commit aeeb0fec)
- ✅ Keep PNG-only saving (commit be253d5c)

**Reconsider changes** (experimental, may need tuning):
- ⚠️ Dimensionality-aware τ₀ floors (may overcorrect, see CODEBASE_CHANGES doc)
- ⚠️ Slab scale 5.0 (consider returning to 2.0 or trying 3.0)
- ✅ Partial centering (likely helps convergence, keep)
- ✅ StandardScaler (correct for prior calibration, keep)

### If Re-Running from Current Code

**Test configuration**:
```yaml
# Conservative hybrid approach
slab_scale: 2.0        # Original (more regularization)
tau0_clinical: 0.5     # Moderate (between 0.3 and 0.8)
tau0_imaging: 0.3      # Original
partial_centering: true   # Keep (improves convergence)
standardscaler: true      # Keep (correct calibration)
```

**Rationale**:
- Keep bug fixes (critical)
- Keep convergence improvements (partial centering, StandardScaler)
- Moderate clinical floor (avoid overcorrection)
- Return to literature-standard slab scale
- Should produce interpretable results with better convergence
