# PCA Dimensionality Reduction Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to use PCA dimensionality reduction in your SGFA analysis, with three pre-configured strategies optimized based on MAD elbow analysis.

## Quick Start

### To use PCA, simply change the preprocessing strategy in config.yaml:

```yaml
preprocessing:
  strategy: "pca_balanced"  # ← Change from "full_preprocessing_all_views"
```

That's it! The pipeline will automatically:
- Apply PCA with the optimal variance threshold
- Save both W_pcs (PC space) and W_voxels (voxel space)
- Generate a README explaining which files to use for brain remapping

## Three Pre-Configured Strategies

### 1. **pca_balanced** (RECOMMENDED ⭐)

```yaml
preprocessing:
  strategy: "pca_balanced"

model:
  K: 10  # Use with 10 factors
```

**Configuration:**
- Variance retained: 85%
- Expected components: ~120
- N/D ratio: ~0.74:1
- Dimensionality reduction: ~91% (1,334 → ~120 voxels)

**When to use:**
- Default choice for most analyses
- Best balance between compression and information retention
- Matches computational efficiency with statistical power

**Rationale:**
Retains enough information for robust factor discovery while providing substantial computational speedup. Based on variance curve analysis, 85% captures the "informative variance" structure.

### 2. **pca_aggressive**

```yaml
preprocessing:
  strategy: "pca_aggressive"

model:
  K: 10  # Use with 10 factors
```

**Configuration:**
- Variance retained: 80%
- Expected components: ~90
- N/D ratio: ~0.89:1 (BEST)
- Dimensionality reduction: ~93% (1,334 → ~90 voxels)

**When to use:**
- Maximum computational speedup needed
- When you trust the MAD elbow analysis (21.5% retention)
- Preliminary exploratory analysis
- When computational resources are limited

**Rationale:**
Most aggressive compression while still retaining meaningful variance. Closely matches your MAD elbow retention rate (21.5%). Provides best N/D ratio for model identifiability.

---

### 3. **pca_conservative**

```yaml
preprocessing:
  strategy: "pca_conservative"

model:
  K: 8  # Reduced to maintain good N/D ratio
```

**Configuration:**
- Variance retained: 90%
- Expected components: ~150
- N/D ratio: ~0.59:1
- Dimensionality reduction: ~89% (1,334 → ~150 voxels)

**When to use:**
- When you want to preserve maximum information
- Final confirmatory analyses
- When interpretation quality is more important than speed
- Clinical validation studies

**Rationale:**
Retains 90% of variance for high-fidelity factor recovery. Slightly reduced K (8 instead of 10) maintains acceptable N/D ratio. Best for ensuring factor interpretability.

## Comparison Table

| Strategy | Variance | Components | Reduction | N/D Ratio | Use Case |
|----------|----------|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | 80% | ~90 | 93% | ~0.89:1 ✓ | Speed, exploration |
| **Balanced** ⭐ | 85% | ~120 | 91% | ~0.74:1 | General use (recommended) |
| **Conservative** | 90% | ~150 | 89% | ~0.59:1 | Confirmatory, clinical |

✓ = Best N/D ratio for model identifiability

## Brain Remapping with PCA

**No changes needed to your MATLAB workflow!**

When PCA is enabled, the pipeline automatically saves two files:

1. **W_pcs_view_X.csv**: Factor loadings in PC space (n_components × K)
   - Direct output from Sparse GFA
   - Use for statistical analysis

2. **W_voxels_view_X.csv**: Factor loadings in voxel space (n_voxels × K)
   - Automatically transformed: W_voxels = PCA.components_.T @ W_pcs
   - **USE THIS FOR BRAIN REMAPPING** ← Your existing MATLAB code works unchanged!

### MATLAB Workflow (Unchanged!)

```matlab
% Load voxel-space loadings (already transformed by pipeline)
W_voxels = readmatrix('W_voxels_view_0.csv');

% Load position lookup (same as always)
positions = readtable('position_sn_voxels.tsv');

% Create brain map for factor k (same as always)
k = 1;
brain_map = positions;
brain_map.loading = W_voxels(:, k);

% Convert to NIfTI (same as always)
% Your existing code here...
```

The pipeline automatically generates a `PCA_BRAIN_REMAPPING_README.md` in your results explaining this in detail.

## How to Choose a Strategy

### Decision Tree:

```
Start here
    ↓
Is computational speed critical?
    YES → Use pca_aggressive (80%, ~90 components)
    NO ↓
        ↓
Is this exploratory or confirmatory analysis?
    Exploratory → Use pca_balanced (85%, ~120 components) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
    Confirmatory → Use pca_conservative (90%, ~150 components)
```

### When NOT to use PCA:

- When you have very few voxels (<200) to begin with
- When voxel-level spatial interpretation is critical
- When you want to compare directly to non-PCA results

## Connection to MAD Elbow Analysis

Your MAD elbow plot showed:
- **Elbow threshold**: 2.87 MAD
- **Retention rate**: 21.5% of voxels
- **Interpretation**: 78.5% of voxels are low-information noise

### How PCA relates:

PCA is **more efficient** than simple voxel selection:
- MAD keeps 21.5% of voxels by removing low-variance ones individually
- PCA finds **orthogonal combinations** that capture variance structure
- Result: PCA can achieve similar information retention with fewer dimensions

**The numbers:**
- MAD elbow: 1,334 → 287 voxels (21.5%)
- PCA aggressive: 1,334 → ~90 components (6.7% of original)
- But PCA's 90 components capture ~80% variance (roughly equivalent information!)

This is why PCA is so powerful - it **finds structure** in the data rather than just removing noisy voxels.

## Advanced: Custom PCA Configuration

If you want to experiment beyond the three pre-configured strategies:

```yaml
preprocessing:
  strategy: "standard"  # Or any other base strategy
  enable_pca: true
  pca_n_components: null           # Use variance threshold
  pca_variance_threshold: 0.87     # Custom threshold (e.g., 87%)
  # OR
  pca_n_components: 100            # Fixed number of components
  pca_whiten: false                # Usually keep false
```

**Recommendations:**
- Keep `pca_whiten: false` to preserve interpretability
- Variance threshold between 0.80-0.95 is reasonable
- Fixed components useful when you want exact reproducibility across runs

---

## Validation

To verify PCA is working correctly:

```bash
# Run factor stability with PCA
python run_experiments.py --experiments factor_stability

# Check the output
ls results/factor_stability_run_*/03_factor_stability/chains/chain_0/
# Should see both:
#   W_pcs_view_0.csv       ← PC space
#   W_voxels_view_0.csv    ← Voxel space (for brain remapping)

# Also check the auto-generated guide:
cat results/factor_stability_run_*/03_factor_stability/PCA_BRAIN_REMAPPING_README.md
```

## Summary

✅ **Use `pca_balanced` (85% variance) for most analyses**

✅ **Your MATLAB brain remapping code works unchanged** - just use W_voxels files

✅ **~90% dimensionality reduction** with minimal information loss

✅ **Faster SGFA convergence** due to better N/D ratios

✅ **Both representations saved automatically** - PC space for analysis, voxel space for visualization
