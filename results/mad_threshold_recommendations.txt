MAD THRESHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS
Data-Driven Analysis of Optimal Outlier Detection Thresholds
================================================================================

CURRENT CONFIGURATION: threshold = 3.0


volume_putamen_voxels
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ELBOW POINT: 4.08
  - Retention at elbow: 72.6%
  - Interpretation: Permissive - retains most voxels, may include some artifacts

CURRENT THRESHOLD (3.0) PERFORMANCE:
  - Voxels retained: 6114 (28.5%)
  - Voxels removed: 15330
  - Variance preserved: 100.0%
  - Correlation preserved: 100.0%

RECOMMENDATION:
  → Consider INCREASING threshold to 4.1
    Current threshold may be too strict, removing biological variability
    Elbow analysis suggests 4.1 provides better data retention


================================================================================
OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Average elbow point across all ROIs: 4.08

RECOMMENDATION: Consider INCREASING threshold to ~4.0 or 4.5
  - Current threshold (3.0) appears too strict for your data
  - You are removing substantial biological variability
  - Higher threshold would improve spatial coverage and signal preservation

For exploratory factor analysis seeking biological subtypes:
  → Consider threshold range 3.5-5.0 to preserve heterogeneous patterns
  → 'Outliers' may represent distinct disease subtypes

For clean signal extraction and hypothesis testing:
  → Consider threshold range 2.5-3.5 for better signal-to-noise ratio
  → Removes artifacts while preserving main effects
