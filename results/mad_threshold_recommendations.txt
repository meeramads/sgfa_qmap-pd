MAD THRESHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS
Data-Driven Analysis of Optimal Outlier Detection Thresholds
================================================================================

CURRENT CONFIGURATION: threshold = 3.0


volume_sn_voxels
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ELBOW POINT: 2.87
  - Retention at elbow: 21.5%
  - Interpretation: Moderate - balanced removal of artifacts while preserving signal

CURRENT THRESHOLD (3.0) PERFORMANCE:
  - Voxels retained: 531 (29.6%)
  - Voxels removed: 1263
  - Variance preserved: 100.0%
  - Correlation preserved: 100.0%

RECOMMENDATION:
  ✓ Current threshold (3.0) is appropriate - close to elbow point
    Provides good balance between artifact removal and signal preservation


================================================================================
OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Average elbow point across all ROIs: 2.87

RECOMMENDATION: Current threshold (3.0) is appropriate
  - Well-aligned with data-driven elbow analysis
  - Provides good balance for your dataset

For exploratory factor analysis seeking biological subtypes:
  → Consider threshold range 3.5-5.0 to preserve heterogeneous patterns
  → 'Outliers' may represent distinct disease subtypes

For clean signal extraction and hypothesis testing:
  → Consider threshold range 2.5-3.5 for better signal-to-noise ratio
  → Removes artifacts while preserving main effects
