MAD THRESHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS
Data-Driven Analysis of Optimal Outlier Detection Thresholds
================================================================================

CURRENT CONFIGURATION: threshold = 3.0


volume_sn_voxels
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ELBOW POINT: 2.26
  - Retention at elbow: 7.1%
  - Interpretation: Very strict - may remove too many voxels with biological variability

CURRENT THRESHOLD (3.0) PERFORMANCE:
  - Voxels retained: 850 (47.4%)
  - Voxels removed: 944
  - Variance preserved: 99.0%
  - Correlation preserved: 100.0%

RECOMMENDATION:
  → Current threshold (3.0) is reasonable but conservative
    Elbow suggests 2.3 but current value retains more signal


================================================================================
OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Average elbow point across all ROIs: 2.26

RECOMMENDATION: Consider DECREASING threshold to ~2.0 or 2.5
  - Current threshold (3.0) may be too permissive
  - Lower threshold would provide cleaner data by removing more artifacts

For exploratory factor analysis seeking biological subtypes:
  → Consider threshold range 3.5-5.0 to preserve heterogeneous patterns
  → 'Outliers' may represent distinct disease subtypes

For clean signal extraction and hypothesis testing:
  → Consider threshold range 2.5-3.5 for better signal-to-noise ratio
  → Removes artifacts while preserving main effects
